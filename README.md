# Where all it starts!
Let's start this amazing documentation based on a noob 3 yr rom hacker experience.
The one who used to play with PGE (Pokemon Game Editor), G3HS (Gen 3 Hacking Suite) and G3T (Gen 3 Tools) started playing with Advance map , HxD, XSE and then 
started to play with Decomps, CFRU, and Hex Maniac. Broke more than 100 roms, made resources. Fine right? Ok, consider this as my intro.
I don't want you to follow my path but just want to tell you a bit : DO NOT TRUST HELP FROM DISCORD.
Actually instead of asking for help from people i helped people. Can you think a person who only knows how to play with PGE helps people (though wrong but something sounding fun?)
This improved my vision. I poured out hours not in asking help but to bringing out my ideas, i borke 1 rom worked again and again, even through a copy paste made script (probably experimenting every script i found on pokecommunity) i made this : https://www.pokecommunity.com/threads/the-most-awaited-buying-pokemon-script-for-gba.456390/
Ignore caps, i was a noob named Luke111 trying to spam and thought caps made your text more clearer xD.

So PEOPLE are you ready to climbing this hurdle? ROM Hacking is nothing but trust in yourself more than others. Break things and make experiments instead of being a slave of already made creeps make your own creep.
##### Ignore all the tool names and things i shared above if you know nothing about them
