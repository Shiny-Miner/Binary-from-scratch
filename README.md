# Where all it starts!
Let's start this amazing documentation based on a noob 3 yr rom hacker experience.
The one who used to play with PGE (Pokemon Game Editor), G3HS (Gen 3 Hacking Suite) and G3T (Gen 3 Tools) started playing with Advance map , HxD, XSE and then 
started to play with Decomps, CFRU, and Hex Maniac. Broke more than 100 roms, made resources. Fine right? Ok, consider this as my intro.
