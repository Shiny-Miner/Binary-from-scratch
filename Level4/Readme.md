So after we gone into very very low level discussion in level 1-2 let's comeback into our main discussion.
# Level 4: Checking how level 2 works by doing it practically
Pre-requisites:
* Any hex edior (Hex maniac advance or HxD)
* mgba or whatever emulator you use for testing
* unzipped .gba fire red
I don't think you need link for the things mentioned above other than hex maniac advance which is already in pack i shared and also on the Pokecommunity link
