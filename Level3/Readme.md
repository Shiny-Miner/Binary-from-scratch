# Level 3 : Information on Rom hacking tools (very much needed)
Have you got bored reading this? Think about me who's writing this all for you.
So after we got to know about bytes and offsets and patches lets learn what we use to manipulate them,
are they graphic or just like headaching like you heard in last section?
``Rom hacking tools are awesome and seriously very much nice GUI is there too (GUI means Graphical-user interference)``
#### More on tools after sucking ur brain
So basically, let's mention them one by one.
We can use that much no. of rom hacking tools or applications or programs that I'll never be able to list all of them out myself.
##### All links below are just for you to checkout, do jot download, I'll provide you a tool pack which have all of them so don't worry.
* [Advance Map](https://www.hackromtools.info/advance-map/?amp=1) (This tool made in 2011 still very stable and used in adding new 'tiles' means a new house or its interior , nappin, assigning script to NPCs (Obviously who are non-player-characters) and more)
[Xse/eXtreme script editor](https://www.hackromtools.info/xse/) (A very stable and good script editor)
## Now you'll ask what are scripts and maps.
Scripts contains the commands and messages like how an Non-Player-Character will work when an event happens.
Maps are very much needed tools. Actually whole game is based on them. They provide you to customise look like how your cuurent city/room/other maps will look, helps you creating and editing new maps, create connections between 2 maps, edit the world map and assign script to Npcs.
Let's comeback!
* [Hex maniac advance](https://www.pokecommunity.com/threads/hexmaniacadvance-a-new-hex-editor-for-gen-3-hacking.428388/)
Tool info: This is a modern day hex editor with amazing GUI and actually demonstrates how really byte change can make difference. Its a one in all tool containing its own map editor, script editor, graphic editor, image editor and its a HEX EDITOR! Level 4 will be containing coverage on this tool + Level 2.
The other tools include HxD (a normal hex editor) , Pokemon Game Editor (PGE) , Gen3Tools (G3T) , some more tiles, image and pokemon editing tools which are of no use to us currently here.
As i said [Here](https://github.com/Shiny-Miner/GBA-Binary-hacking-assets) is the link that contains all tools + lot of graphics (garbage for you right now) its useless using them until i say.
Pass to Level 4 now here:
